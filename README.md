# HTTP Proxy Server in C

This project is a **simple HTTP proxy server implemented in C**.  
The proxy accepts client connections, forwards HTTP requests to target servers, relays responses back to clients, and logs all activity.

The project demonstrates **low-level networking**, **socket programming**, **file I/O**, and **Makefile-based builds**.

---

## Features

- Written in **pure C**
- Uses **TCP socket programming**
- Forwards HTTP client requests
- Relays server responses back to clients
- Maintains a **log file** of proxy activity
- Configurable using a configuration file
- Built using a **Makefile**

- **DESIGN.md**  
  Explains the internal working, flow of requests, and design decisions.

---

### `config/`
Contains configuration files.

- **server.conf**  
  Used to configure proxy server settings such as port number and logging behavior.

---

### `src/`
Contains build-related files.

- **Makefile**  
  Used to compile the proxy server source code.

---

### `logs/`
Stores runtime logs generated by the proxy server.

- **proxy.log**  
  Logs client requests, timestamps, target servers, and request status.

---

### Root Files

- **main.c**  
  Entry point of the proxy server.  
  Handles:
  - Socket creation and binding
  - Accepting client connections
  - Forwarding requests
  - Relaying responses
  - Writing logs

- **proxy_server.exe**  
  Compiled executable generated after building the project.
